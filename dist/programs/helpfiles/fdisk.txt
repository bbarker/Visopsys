 -- fdisk --

Also known as the "Disk Manager", fdisk is a hard disk partitioning tool.
It can create, delete, format, resize, and move partitions and modify their
attributes.  It can copy entire hard disks from one to another.

Usage:
  fdisk [-T] [disk_name]

The fdisk program is interactive, and can be used in either text or graphics
mode.  It provides the same functionality in both modes; text mode operation
is menu-driven.

The disk can be automatically selected by specifying its name (as listed by
the 'disks' command) as the last argument.

Options:
-T  : Force text mode operation
