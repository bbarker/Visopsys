 -- vsh --

The Visopsys Shell.

Usage:
  vsh [-c command]

'vsh' is the Visopsys command line shell (interpreter).  In text mode the
login program automatically launches an instance of vsh for you.  In graphics
mode there is no 'default' command line shell, but clicking on the
'Command Window' icon or running the 'window' command will create a window
with an instance of vsh running inside it.

Normally, vsh operates interactively.  However, if the (optional) -c
parameter is supplied, vsh will execute the command that follows.  If the
command contains spaces or tab characters, it must be surrounded by
double-quotes (").
