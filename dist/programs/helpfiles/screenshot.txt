 -- screenshot --

Save the current screen to an image file.

Usage:
  screenshot [file_name]

(Only available in graphics mode)

The (optional) file name can be an absolute pathname under which the
screenshot should be saved.  If no file name is specified, the program
will present a dialog box asking for one.

Currently only the uncompressed, 24-bit bitmap format is supported.
