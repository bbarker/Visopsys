 -- keymap --

View or change the current keyboard mapping

Usage:
  keymap [-T] [-p] [-s file_name] [keymap_name]

The keymap program can be used to view the available keyboard mapping, or
set the current map.  It works in both text and graphics modes:

A particular keymap can be selected by supplying a file name for keymap_name,
or else using its descriptive name (with double quotes (") around it if it
contains space characters).

If no keymap is specified on the command line, the current default one will
be selected.

In text mode:

  The -p option will print a detailed listing of the selected keymap.

  The -s option will save the selected keymap using the supplied file name.

  The -x option will convert a version 1 keymap to version 2.

  If a keymap is specified without the -p or -s options, then the keymap will
  be set as the current default.

  With no options, all available mappings are listed, with the current default
  indicated.

In graphics mode, the program is interactive and the user can select and
manipulate keymaps visually.

Options:
-p  : Print a detailed listing of the keymap (text mode).
-s  : Save the specified keymap to the supplied file name (text mode).
-T  : Force text mode operation
-x  : Convert a version 1 keymap to version 2 (text mode).
