 -- mount --

Mount a filesystem.

Usage:
  mount <disk> [mount_point]

This command will mount (make usable) the filesystem on the specified logical
disk.  Available logical disks can be listed using the 'disks' command.
The second parameter is a location (the mount point) where the contents of
the filesystem should be mounted.  The mount point parameter is optional if
it is listed in the mount configuration file (usually located at
/system/config/mount.conf).

Example:
  mount cd0 /cdrom

This will mount the first CD-ROM device, and make its contents accessible
in the /cdrom subdirectory.

Note that the mount point parameter should specify a name that does *not*
exist.  This is the opposite of the UNIX mount command behaviour.  The
example above will fail if there is already a file or directory called /cdrom.
