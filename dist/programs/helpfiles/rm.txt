 -- rm --

Remove (delete) one or more files.

Synonym:
  del

Usage:
  rm [-R] [-S#] <file1> [file2] [...]

This command will remove one or more files.  Normally it will not remove
directories.  To remove a directory, use the 'rmdir' command.

Options:
-R              : Force recursive deletion, including directories.
-S[number]      : Securely delete the file by overwriting it with random
                  data (number minus 1 times) and then NULLs, and then
                  deleting the file.  The default number value is 5 if no
                  value is supplied.

Note the -S option is not allowed if the -R option is used.
